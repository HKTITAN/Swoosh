## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Working

- ✅ Try different camera index in settings
- ✅ Restart Swoosh after changing cameras
- ✅ Check camera permissions (especially on macOS)

#### Gestures Not Detected
- ✅ Improve lighting conditions
- ✅ Increase sensitivity in settings
- ✅ Check hand distance from camera
- ✅ Ensure hand is clearly visible

#### Performance Issues
- ✅ Close other camera applications
- ✅ Lower detection confidence slightly
- ✅ Disable visual effects if needed
- ✅ Check system resources (CPU/RAM usage)

#### Sound Problems
- ✅ Check system volume settings
- ✅ Test sounds in Swoosh settings
- ✅ Restart application if sounds don't work
- ✅ Check audio drivers

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Windows

- May need to allow camera access in Privacy settings
- Some antivirus software may flag the global hotkey feature

#### macOS
- Camera permission required on first run
- Accessibility permissions may be needed for hotkeys
- Command key used instead of Ctrl for window switching

#### Linux
- May need additional packages: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev libgl1-mesa-glx`
- Camera access permissions may vary by distribution
- Test with different camera backends if issues occur

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Hotkeys
You can modify the global hotkey in the code:
```python
shortcut_str = '<ctrl>+<shift>+a'  # Change this line in setup_hotkey_listener()
```

### Custom Actions
Add your own actions by modifying the `handleGesture` method in the `OverlayWindow` class.

### Sound Customization
Replace sound files in the `sounds/` directory or modify the `SoundManager` class to use your own audio effects.
